# Contributing

<div align="center"> Hey there! We love getting contributions from the community, so if you're interested in helping out with Team Production System, we'd be thrilled to have you on board. Here's what you need to do:
</div>

---

1. First off, fork the repository so you can make changes to your own copy of the code. 
Fork the Team Production System repository on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. 
![alt text](../LMT-Backend/static/ReadMe/Screenshot%202023-03-13%20at%208.10.14%20PM.png "Fork") This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

2. Create a new branch for your changes
Once you've forked the repository, create a new branch for your changes. We recommend naming the branch something descriptive, like "my-new-feature", so it's clear what you're working on.

To create a new branch using Git, run the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```
Replace "my-new-feature" with your chosen branch name.


3. Now it's time to make your changes! This is the fun part, where you get to add your own personal touch to the code. When you're done, commit your changes with a message that describes what you did, like "Add awesome new feature".

```bash
git commit -am "Add awesome new feature"
```
Replace "Add awesome new feature" with a short, descriptive message that summarizes the changes you've made.

4. After you've committed your changes, push them to your fork of the repository. This will make your changes visible to others, and allow you to submit a pull request.
Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git push origin my-new-feature
```
Replace "my-new-feature" with the name of the branch you created in step 2.

5. Finally, submit a pull request to the main repository. This lets us know that you've made some changes that you'd like us to review and potentially incorporate into the main codebase. We'll take a look as soon as we can, and get back to you with any feedback or questions we have.
Visit the Team Production System repository on GitHub and click the "New pull request" button. Select your forked repository and the branch you created in step 2, and then click "Create pull request". This will open a new pull request in the main repository.

One last thing - we want to make sure that everyone who contributes to Team Production System feels welcome and respected. So please make sure to follow our code of conduct, which you can find here ðŸ‘‰ [code of conduct](https://github.com/TeamProductionSystem/Team_Production_System_BE/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Thanks, and happy coding!
